Your
participation is necessary to collect ANONYMOUS data regarding your
experience and working habits with software refactoring. Your
participation will allow us to collect the data to understand the
perspective of practitioners about refactoring, and&nbsp; how it is
performed in the industries. Your participation will require
approximately 20 minutes of your time. <br>

in an office at Polytechnique Montreal. The researchers will use all of
the data for the sole objectives of the survey briefly described above.<br>
<br>
The information will be stored in the computers of the Swat lab
during the study.&nbsp; These machines are protected by password
and
only Foutse Khomh can grant access to the machine, and only Rodrigo
Morales have permission to work on the computers assigned to this
project. &nbsp;The data will be kept for a 10-year period, after
